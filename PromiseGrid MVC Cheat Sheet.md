# **PromiseGrid MVC Cheat Sheet**

## **1\. Model (Stores and Manages Data)**

* Stores **ownership, permissions, and consensus rules** for decentralized computing.  
* Manages **capability-based security** for access control.  
* Uses **Promise Theory** to structure permissions and commitments.  
* Implements a **content-addressable model**, where data is referenced by its content instead of location.  
* Supports **decentralized caching** to maintain performance and resilience.  
* Provides **computational governance** to automate decision-making and enforce policies.

  ## **2\. View (User Interface & Output)**

* Provides a **web-based interface and command-line tools** for user interaction.  
* Displays **file structures, governance policies, and consensus results**.  
* Supports **modular applications** that can be loaded from a URL and executed in a browser tab or CLI.  
* Uses **a decentralized protocol** to present user-accessible resources.

  ## **3\. Controller (Processes Actions & Enforces Rules)**

* Manages **system calls** for governance, consensus, and conflict resolution.  
* Implements **merge-as-consensus** mechanisms to handle decision-making.  
* Routes **capability-based requests**, ensuring only authorized actions occur.  
* Uses **Promise Theory** to validate actions before executing them.  
* Operates as a **sandbox orchestrator**, executing applications across various environments (WASM, containers, bare metal).
